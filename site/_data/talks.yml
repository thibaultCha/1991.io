    title: Developing a user-friendly OpenResty application 
    event:
        title: OpenResty Con 2017
        link: https://con.openresty.com
        location: Beijing, China - October 21st, 2017
    slides: https://www.slideshare.net/ThibaultCharbonnier/developing-a-userfriendly-openresty-application
    description: >
        Kong is a widely-adopted open source API Gateway built with
        OpenResty. It aims at helping secure, manage, and extend
        microservices-based architectures with minimal effort from the
        user, while ensuring platform agnosticism.

        In this talk, we will explore the challenges we encountered
        developing such an OpenResty application, and how we overcame many
        of them by way of libraries and contributions back to the OpenResty
        community. We will cover topics such as clustering OpenResty nodes,
        inter-workers communication, DNS resolution, typical pitfalls
        OpenResty developers should avoid, and much more.

    description: >
        A critical component of the Kong API Gateway, the lua-cassandra
        library originated from the Lua community, and is now being
        actively maintained by Mashape (now Kong Inc.).

        We will study its story, its new features such as clustering
        support, good practices for LuaJIT/OpenResty development, and
        propose some solutions to the difficulties of maintaining Lua code
        for PUC-Lua, LuaJIT, and OpenResty.
